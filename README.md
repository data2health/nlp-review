# nlp-review

### Phase I project related to systematic review of the Natural Language Processing field

In an effort to identify Natural Language Processing implementations that improve patient care and processes, we are conducting a systematic scoping review.  Most NLP research projects measure their outcomes in terms of fidelity to a gold standard.  While this is a necessary component to a NLP system it is not sufficient to answer whether or not NLP is adding value to a health care process.  For this review, we located research in the area of NLP of text from electronic health records, and identified the outcome measures being used in addition to or instead of accuracy and precision.  In addition, we identified the funding mechanisms, research group make-up, medical specialties and special conditions for all of these research project.  We hope to identify patterns in research that has been able to successfully push NLP research beyond accuracy and into operationalized use in a health care system.  The methodology developed to produce this scoping review can now also be applied to other areas of interest to CD2H.
